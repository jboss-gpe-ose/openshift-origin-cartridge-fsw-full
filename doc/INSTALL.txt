    1)  Create an OSE 1.2 environment that supports a medium gear size
    2)  Install OSE 1.2 rhc tools
    3)  Delete any previous fsw related OSE applications that you may have previously created:
            rhc app delete -a fswtest

    4)  Create the *full* FSW6 *full* OSE application :
        rhc create-app fswtest https://raw.github.com/jboss-gpe-ose/openshift-origin-cartridge-fsw-full/master/metadata/manifest.yml -g int_dev_medium

    5)  Add mysql cartridge:
        rhc cartridge add -a fswtest -c mysql-5.1

    6)  restart app:  rhc cartridge-restart fsw -a fswtest
